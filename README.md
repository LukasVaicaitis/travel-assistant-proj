## About
This is a Next.js client application project thatt I made during my studies.

The purpose of this app is to ease the task of creating a viable traveling location by providing weather, places and flights data about a travel destination using third-party API's.

API's used:
* OpenWeather API
* Geoapify API
* RapidAPI Tripadvisor
* Google API

## Getting Started

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To enable functionality, an .env file with keys to each respective API service is required at the root of the project.
